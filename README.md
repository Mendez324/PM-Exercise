# PM-Exercise

This is an exercise for an interview

I made this exercise using HTML, Sass, and Javascript.
Didn't use Bootstrap because i wanted to show what i've learned in my Edit course.
I choose to use Webpack because i wanted to test on my own, how to use a taskrunner, and i made a convert scss to css file even tho it doesn't convert each time i save.
On the Scss using BEM really makes it easy for someone who's watching my code to understand from which componets the scss corresponds to.

## How to run the project

- To load this project you should have Node installed on your computer.
- Go to the root of the project and run cmd "npm install" before opening any html.
- i tryed to learn a bit of webpack because i was converting scss to css with Prepros program and it was time to stop and learn a task runner.
- Project is working on 1920x1080 and 1366x768 resolutions.

- Sass files are writing diferently because i'm using BEM way of writing

-Checkboxes took a while to do because i never made custom ones
